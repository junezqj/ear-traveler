A small program that mimics NetEase Cloud. Temporarily have achieved some basic functions, likes listening to music, lyrics scrolling, get song lists and comments as well as searching songs.

## how to start?
Actually, I don't know. Maybe you just need to clone the code. And you need a software HBuilder X. Finally just run it.
I have to say that this is just an easy demo with its disadvantages. But it helps me to have a brief understanding of uniapp.
Now it already has an experience version, you can search for a mini-program "只玫瑰一朵" on WeChat.
If you are interested, just contact me. I will add you to the list of experienced people.
